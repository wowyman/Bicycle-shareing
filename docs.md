# Docs: semantic web project

## Code, scripts..

All the code and scripts are in my github, in this [repository](https://github.com/alaouiib/Bicycle-Sharing-system-SemanticWeb/).
Please Clone the project in your computer to find all the sources code's components.

## Vocabularies

The vocabularies we require for the project are as following:
<a><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zVPJgkP/json-Description.png" alt="json-Description" border="1"></a>
In addition to that, we generate another vocabulary item `(ID)` to identify each station. this ID should be unique, so we take the name of the station (clean from special characters) concatenated with its ZIP code.

## Turle file example

Here is an example (few N-triples) of the turtle file that we generate from data coming from the different data sources (APIs):

    @prefix ex: <http://example.org/#>.
    @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.
    @prefix geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>.
    @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.
    @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.
    @prefix rel: <http://relations.example.com/>.

    ex:Chateaucreux42000 a geo:SpatialThing;
    rdfs:label "Chateaucreux"@fr;
    geo:lat "45.442972"^^xsd:decimal;
    geo:lon "4.398855"^^xsd:decimal;
    rel:STATUS "OPEN";
    rel:ADDRESS "101 ChÃ¢teaucreux "^^xsd:langString;
    rel:FREE_BIKES "23"^^xsd:integer;
    rel:EMPTY_SLOTS "9"^^xsd:integer;
    rel:TOTAL_SLOTS "32"^^xsd:integer;
    rel:LAST_UPDATE "1572010093"^^xsd:integer;
    rel:CB_PAYMENT "0"^^xsd:integer;
    rel:ZIP_CODE "42000"^^xsd:integer;
    rel:COMMUNE "Saint-Etienne"@fr.

> Note: you can find an extended turtle file called `Project_data2.ttl` inside the `server` folder.

## RDFa and Json-ld

As said in the presentation, the data is encoded and embedded as RDFa and Json-ld in all the pages of each specific station. In order to find it in the code, and since the pages are client rendered (in the front end):

1- please tap <kbd>F12</kbd> to inspect the page element
2- copy the `html` tag ( **the first element of the page** )
3- paste it in your RDFa or Json-ld provider. (I use [RDFa](http://rdfa.info/play/) or [Json-ld](https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/#distill_by_input))

## Install Instruction

### Requirements:

1- Jena fuzeki server **running** on default port (3030).
2- Nodejs Installed ( [how to install Nodejs](https://wsvincent.com/install-node-js-npm-windows/) )

The project is a full stack application, so there is two component:

### Back end (server)

The back end has been created using `Nodejs`.
This part's code is in the `server` folder, this latter contains 2 important files:

- **index.js**: this is the file that contains the Nodejs code (main) of the API
- **package.json**: this file contains _the dependencies_ as well as some additional information. (description, test script,keywords...)

In order to get the setup of the project:

1.  Make sure you are in the directory `Bicycle-Sharing-system-SemanticWeb/server/`.
2.  Run the following command: `npm install`
    and Done !
    In order to run the application, run this command: `node index.js`

There is 4 .js files in the same folder:

- **lyon-data.js, saint-etienne-data.js** : code for creating lyon and saint-etienne cities.
- **newCity-data.js**: code for creating any city available in the Jcdeceaux API.
- **createCity-data.js**: code for creating any _new_ city manually.

### Front end (client)

The Front end has been created in`Vue.js`.
This part's code is in the `client/myclient` folder, this folder contains the views, the components created, and all the files related to the front end of the project.

In order to get the setup of the project:

1.  Make sure you are in the directory `Bicycle-Sharing-system-SemanticWeb/client/myclient`.
2.  Run the following command: `npm install`
    and Done !
    In order to run the application, run this command: `npm run serve`.

Finally, go to the web page using this URL: http://localhost:8080/
